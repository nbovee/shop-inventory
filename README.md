# Django + Docker = ❤️
This simple Django project is an excellent template for your future projects. It includes everything you need to quickly set up a quality technology stack and start developing your web application's business logic, skipping all the complex deployment issues at an early stage.

## Technology stack
The technology stack used includes:
- [`Python`](https://www.python.org) ver. 3.11
- [`Django`](https://www.djangoproject.com) ver. 4.2
- [`PostgreSQL`](https://www.postgresql.org) ver. 15
- [`Gunicorn`](https://gunicorn.org) ver. 20.1
- [`Traefik`](https://traefik.io/traefik/) ver. 2.9
- [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [`Docker Compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

Nothing extra, only the essentials! You can easily add everything else yourself by expanding the existing configuration files:
- [requirements.txt](https://github.com/amerkurev/django-docker-template/blob/master/requirements.txt)
- [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/amerkurev/django-docker-template/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
- and others...

> This project includes a simple Django application from the official Django tutorial - ["a basic poll application"](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/). You can safely delete this application at any time. This application is present in the project as an example, used for testing and debugging.

So, what do you get by using this project as a template for your project? Let's take a look.
