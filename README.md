## How to use

### For Deployment as intended
> TODO Here we will describe the process to setup up a local raspberry pi to run the inventory system.

### For development on your computer

1. Clone the repository to your computer and go to the `shop-inventory` directory:
```console
git clone https://github.com/nbovee/shop-inventory.git
cd shop-inventory
```
Using VSCode, you may launch the debugpy tool into your development server by running "Simple Debug" from the Run and Debug tab of the IDE.

Now you can go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser.

> Note that we mount the directory with your source code inside the container, so you can work with the project in your IDE, and changes will be visible inside the container, and the Django development server will restart itself.

2. Run tests with pytest and coverage âœ…:
```console
uv run pytest
```
The pytest tool runs tests using pytest-django and pytest-cov (wrapping coverage). As a result, you will see an output like this in the terminal:
```console
uv run pytest

#### Django settings

Some Django settings from the [`settings.py`](shop-inventory/_core/settings.py) file are stored in environment variables. You can easily change these settings in the [`.env`](.env) file. This file does not contain all the necessary settings, but many of them. Add additional settings to environment variables if needed.

> It is important to note the following: **never store sensitive settings such as DJANGO_SECRET_KEY or DJANGO_EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD in your repository!**
> Docker allows you to override environment variable values from additional files, the command line, or the current session. Store passwords and other sensitive information separately from the code and only connect this information at system startup.
