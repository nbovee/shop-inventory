# Django + Docker = ❤️
This simple Django project is an excellent foundation for your own future projects. 
The project includes everything necessary to quickly deploy a quality technology stack and 
start developing the business logic of your web application, skipping all the complex deployment issues at an early stage.

**The technology stack used includes:**
- [`Django`](https://www.djangoproject.com) ver. 4.2
- [`PostgreSQL`](https://www.postgresql.org) ver. 15
- [`Gunicorn`](https://gunicorn.org) (WSGI HTTP Server) ver. 20.1
- [`Traefik`](https://traefik.io/traefik/) (reverse proxy) ver. 2.9
- [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [`Docker Compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

Nothing extra, only the essentials! You can easily add everything else yourself by expanding the existing configuration files:
- [requirements.txt](https://github.com/amerkurev/django-docker-template/blob/master/requirements.txt)
- [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/amerkurev/django-docker-template/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
- and others...
