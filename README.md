# Django + Docker = ❤️
This simple Django project is an excellent foundation for your own future projects. 
The project includes everything necessary to quickly deploy a quality technology stack and 
start developing the business logic of your web application, skipping all the complex deployment issues at an early stage.

**The technology stack used includes:**
- [`Django`](https://www.djangoproject.com)
- [`PostgreSQL`](https://www.postgresql.org)
- [`Gunicorn`](https://gunicorn.org) (WSGI HTTP Server)
- [`Traefik`](https://traefik.io/traefik/) (reverse proxy)
- [`Docker` and `Docker Compose`](https://www.docker.com)

Nothing extra, only the essentials! You can easily add everything else yourself by expanding the existing configuration files ([requirements.txt](https://github.com/amerkurev/django-docker-template/blob/master/requirements.txt), [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/amerkurev/django-docker-template/blob/master/docker-compose.yml), and others).
