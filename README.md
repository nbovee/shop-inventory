# Django + Docker = ‚ù§Ô∏è
This simple Django project is an excellent template for your future projects. It includes everything you need to quickly set up a quality technology stack and start developing your web application's business logic, skipping all the complex deployment issues at an early stage.

## Technology stack
The technology stack used includes:
- [`Python`](https://www.python.org) ver. 3.11
- [`Django`](https://www.djangoproject.com) ver. 4.2
- [`PostgreSQL`](https://www.postgresql.org) ver. 15
- [`Gunicorn`](https://gunicorn.org) ver. 20.1
- [`Traefik`](https://traefik.io/traefik/) ver. 2.9
- [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [`Docker Compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

Nothing extra, only the essentials! You can easily add everything else yourself by expanding the existing configuration files:
- [requirements.txt](https://github.com/amerkurev/django-docker-template/blob/master/requirements.txt)
- [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/amerkurev/django-docker-template/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
- and others...

> This project includes a simple Django application from the official Django tutorial - ["a basic poll application"](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/). You can safely delete this application at any time. This application is present in the project as an example, used for testing and debugging.

So, what do you get by using this project as a template for your project? Let's take a look.

## Features
- A well-configured Django project, with individual settings that can be changed using environment variables
- Building and debugging a Django project in Docker
- A ready-made docker-compose file that brings together Postgres - Django - Gunicorn - Traefik
- Automatic database migration and static file collection when starting or restarting the Django container
- Automatic creation of the first user in Django with a default login and password
- Automatic creation and renewal of Let's Encrypt certificate üî•
- Minimal dependencies
- Everything is set up as simply as possible - just a couple of commands in the terminal, and you have a working project üöÄ

## How to use

### For development on your computer
1. Clone the repository to your computer and go to the `django-docker-template` directory:
```console
git clone https://github.com/amerkurev/django-docker-template.git
cd django-docker-template
```

2. Build the Docker container image with Django:
```console
docker build -t amerkurev/django_docker_template:master .
```

3. Start the Django development server inside the Django container:
```console
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 -v $(pwd)/website:/usr/src/website amerkurev/django_docker_template:master python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Now you can go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ in your browser. The superuser with login and password `admin/admin` is already created. Go to the Django admin panel and try updating the server code "on the fly." Everything works just like if you were running the Django development server outside the container. 
> Note: in this case, the Postgres database is not running, and Django is working with the SQLite database.

4. Run tests:
```console
docker run -it --rm amerkurev/django_docker_template:master python manage.py test polls
```

5. Interactive shell with the Django project environment:
```console
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/website:/usr/src/website amerkurev/django_docker_template:master python manage.py shell
```

6. Start all services locally (Postgres, Gunicorn, Traefik) using docker-compose:
```console
docker compose up
```

Enjoy watching the lines run in the terminal üñ•Ô∏è   
And after a few seconds, open your browser at http://127.0.0.1/admin/. The first user already exists, welcome to the Django admin panel.
